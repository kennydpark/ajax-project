# MovieJournal

A web application for movie enthusiasts who want to keep track of movies, as well as rate and review them.

 Movies are a huge passion of mine and I was itching to build something that could be useful to not only me, but also others who have a similar interest. It made complete sense to have an intuitive and simple app that allows users to conveniently look up movies and bookmark them for reference to add notes to.
